# SkullBears

The Newbz's entry to Porto Graphic's 2016 GameJam. Theme: Twist

Simple platform game where the goal is to survive as long as possible without dieing. If you hit the bear to the left or run out of life, your lose. Smaller bears reduce life while the candy gives you life. The more the time passes the faster the game goes.

Arrows keys move left and right while Z key jumps. 

Feel free to look at and play.
